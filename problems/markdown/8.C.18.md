18 Suppose $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n-1} \in \mathbf{C}$. Find the minimal and characteristic polynomials of the operator on $\mathbf{C}^{n}$ whose matrix (with respect to the standard basis) is
\[
\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & & & & -a_{0} \\
1 & 0 & & & -a_{1} \\
& 1 & \ddots & & -a_{2} \\
& & \ddots & & \vdots \\
& & & 0 & -a_{n-2} \\
& & & 1 & -a_{n-1}
\end{array}\right)
\]
[The exercise above shows that every monic polynomial is the characteristic polynomial of some operator.]
