32 Suppose $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}$ is a list of distinct real numbers. Prove that the list $e^{\lambda_{1} x}, \ldots, e^{\lambda_{n} x}$ is linearly independent in the vector space of real-valued functions on $\mathbf{R}$.

Hint: Let $V=\operatorname{span}\left(e^{\lambda_{1} x}, \ldots, e^{\lambda_{n} x}\right)$, and define an operator $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ by $T f=f^{\prime}$. Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $T$.
