14 The angle between two vectors (thought of as arrows with initial point at the origin) in $\mathbf{R}^{2}$ or $\mathbf{R}^{3}$ can be defined geometrically. However, geometry is not as clear in $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ for $n>3$. Thus the angle between two nonzero vectors $x, y \in \mathbf{R}^{n}$ is defined to be
\[
\arccos \frac{\langle x, y\rangle}{\|x\|\|y\|},
\]
where the motivation for this definition comes from the previous exercise. Explain why the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is needed to show that this definition makes sense.
