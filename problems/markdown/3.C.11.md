11 Suppose $a=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}a_{1} & \cdots & a_{n}\end{array}\right)$ is a 1-by- $n$ matrix and $C$ is an $n$-by- $p$ matrix. Prove that
\[
a C=a_{1} C_{1, '}+\cdots+a_{n} C_{n, '} .
\]
In other words, show that $a C$ is a linear combination of the rows of $C$, with the scalars that multiply the rows coming from $a$.
