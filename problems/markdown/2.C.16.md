16 Suppose $U_{1}, \ldots, U_{m}$ are finite-dimensional subspaces of $V$ such that $U_{1}+\cdots+U_{m}$ is a direct sum. Prove that $U_{1} \oplus \cdots \oplus U_{m}$ is finitedimensional and
\[
\operatorname{dim} U_{1} \oplus \cdots \oplus U_{m}=\operatorname{dim} U_{1}+\cdots+\operatorname{dim} U_{m} .
\]
[The exercise above deepens the analogy between direct sums of subspaces and disjoint unions of subsets. Specifically, compare this exercise to the following obvious statement: if a set is written as a disjoint union of finite subsets, then the number of elements in the set equals the sum of the numbers of elements in the disjoint subsets.]
