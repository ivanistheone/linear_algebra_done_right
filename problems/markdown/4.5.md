5 Suppose $m$ is a nonnegative integer, $z_{1}, \ldots, z_{m+1}$ are distinct elements of $\mathbf{F}$, and $w_{1}, \ldots, w_{m+1} \in \mathbf{F}$. Prove that there exists a unique polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}_{m}(\mathbf{F})$ such that
\[
p\left(z_{j}\right)=w_{j}
\]
for $j=1, \ldots, m+1$.
[This result can be proved without using linear algebra. However, try to find the clearer, shorter proof that uses some linear algebra.]
