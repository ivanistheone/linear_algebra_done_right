3 Suppose $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ is a list of vectors in $V$. Define $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{F}^{m}, V\right)$ by
\[
T\left(z_{1}, \ldots, z_{m}\right)=z_{1} v_{1}+\cdots+z_{m} v_{m} .
\]
(a) What property of $T$ corresponds to $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ spanning $V$ ?
(b) What property of $T$ corresponds to $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ being linearly independent?
