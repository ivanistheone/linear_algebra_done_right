8 Give an example of a function $\varphi: \mathbf{R}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ such that
\[
\varphi(a v)=a \varphi(v)
\]
for all $a \in \mathbf{R}$ and all $v \in \mathbf{R}^{2}$ but $\varphi$ is not linear.
[The exercise above and the next exercise show that neither homogeneity nor additivity alone is enough to imply that a function is a linear map.]
