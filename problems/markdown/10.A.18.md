18 Suppose $V$ is an inner product space with orthonormal basis $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}$ and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Prove that
\[
\operatorname{trace}\left(T^{*} T\right)=\left\|T e_{1}\right\|^{2}+\cdots+\left\|T e_{n}\right\|^{2} .
\]
Conclude that the right side of the equation above is independent of which orthonormal basis $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}$ is chosen for $V$.
