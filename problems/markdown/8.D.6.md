6 Suppose $N \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is nilpotent and $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}$ and $m_{1}, \ldots, m_{n}$ are as in 8.55. Prove that $N^{m_{1}} v_{1}, \ldots, N^{m_{n}} v_{n}$ is a basis of null $N$.
[The exercise above implies that $n$, which equals $\operatorname{dim}$ null $N$, depends only on $N$ and not on the specific Jordan basis chosen for $N$.]
