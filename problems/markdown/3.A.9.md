9 Give an example of a function $\varphi: \mathbf{C} \rightarrow \mathbf{C}$ such that
\[
\varphi(w+z)=\varphi(w)+\varphi(z)
\]
for all $w, z \in \mathbf{C}$ but $\varphi$ is not linear. (Here $\mathbf{C}$ is thought of as a complex vector space.)
[There also exists a function $\varphi: \mathbf{R} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ such that $\varphi$ satisfies the additivity condition above but $\varphi$ is not linear. However, showing the existence of such a function involves considerably more advanced tools.]
