7 Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $T$ has a block diagonal matrix
\[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
A_{1} & & 0 \\
& \ddots & \\
0 & & A_{m}
\end{array}\right)
\]
with respect to some basis of $V$. For $j=1, \ldots, m$, let $T_{j}$ be the operator on $V$ whose matrix with respect to the same basis is a block diagonal matrix with blocks the same size as in the matrix above, with $A_{j}$ in the $j^{\text {th }}$ block, and with all the other blocks on the diagonal equal to identity matrices (of the appropriate size). Prove that $T=T_{1} \cdots T_{m}$.
