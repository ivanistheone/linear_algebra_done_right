21 A norm on a vector space $U$ is a function \|\|$: U \rightarrow[0, \infty)$ such that $\|u\|=0$ if and only if $u=0,\|\alpha u\|=|\alpha|\|u\|$ for all $\alpha \in \mathbf{F}$ and all $u \in U$, and $\|u+v\| \leq\|u\|+\|v\|$ for all $u, v \in U$. Prove that a norm satisfying the parallelogram equality comes from an inner product (in other words, show that if \|\| is a norm on $U$ satisfying the parallelogram equality, then there is an inner product $\langle,$,$rangle on U$ such that $\|u\|=\langle u, u\rangle^{1 / 2}$ for all $u \in U$.
