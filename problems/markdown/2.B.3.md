3 (a) Let $U$ be the subspace of $\mathbf{R}^{5}$ defined by
\[
U=\left\{\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}\right) \in \mathbf{R}^{5}: x_{1}=3 x_{2} \text { and } x_{3}=7 x_{4}\right\}
\]
Find a basis of $U$.
(b) Extend the basis in part (a) to a basis of $\mathbf{R}^{5}$.
(c) Find a subspace $W$ of $\mathbf{R}^{5}$ such that $\mathbf{R}^{5}=U \oplus W$.
