26 Suppose $f, g$ are differentiable functions from $\mathbf{R}$ to $\mathbf{R}^{n}$.
(a) Show that
\[
\langle f(t), g(t)\rangle^{\prime}=\left\langle f^{\prime}(t), g(t)\right\rangle+\left\langle f(t), g^{\prime}(t)\right\rangle .
\]
(b) Suppose $c>0$ and $\|f(t)\|=c$ for every $t \in \mathbf{R}$. Show that $\left\langle f^{\prime}(t), f(t)\right\rangle=0$ for every $t \in \mathbf{R}$.
(c) Interpret the result in part (b) geometrically in terms of the tangent vector to a curve lying on a sphere in $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ centered at the origin.
[For the exercise above, a function $f: \mathbf{R} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{n}$ is called differentiable if there exist differentiable functions $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n}$ from $\mathbf{R}$ to $\mathbf{R}$ such that $f(t)=\left(f_{1}(t), \ldots, f_{n}(t)\right)$ for each $t \in \mathbf{R}$. Furthermore, for each $t \in \mathbf{R}$, the derivative $f^{\prime}(t) \in \mathbf{R}^{n}$ is defined by $f^{\prime}(t)=\left(f_{1}^{\prime}(t), \ldots, f_{n}^{\prime}(t)\right)$.]
