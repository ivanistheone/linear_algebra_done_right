23 Suppose $V_{1}, \ldots, V_{m}$ are inner product spaces. Show that the equation
\[
\left\langle\left(u_{1}, \ldots, u_{m}\right),\left(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}\right)\right\rangle=\left\langle u_{1}, v_{1}\right\rangle+\cdots+\left\langle u_{m}, v_{m}\right\rangle
\]
defines an inner product on $V_{1} \times \cdots \times V_{m}$.
[In the expression above on the right, $\left\langle u_{1}, v_{1}\right\rangle$ denotes the inner product on $V_{1}, \ldots,\left\langle u_{m}, v_{m}\right\rangle$ denotes the inner product on $V_{m}$. Each of the spaces $V_{1}, \ldots, V_{m}$ may have a different inner product, even though the same notation is used here.]
