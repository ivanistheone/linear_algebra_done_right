6 Make $\mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbf{R})$ into an inner product space by defining
\[
\langle p, q\rangle=\int_{0}^{1} p(x) q(x) d x .
\]
Define $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbf{R})\right)$ by $T\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+a_{2} x^{2}\right)=a_{1} x$.
(a) Show that $T$ is not self-adjoint.
(b) The matrix of $T$ with respect to the basis $\left(1, x, x^{2}\right)$ is
\[
\left(\begin{array}{lll}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right) .
\]
This matrix equals its conjugate transpose, even though $T$ is not self-adjoint. Explain why this is not a contradiction.
