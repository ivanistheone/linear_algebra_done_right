17 For $u \in V$, let $\Phi u$ denote the linear functional on $V$ defined by
\[
(\Phi u)(v)=\langle v, u\rangle
\]
for $v \in V$.
(a) Show that if $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}$, then $\Phi$ is a linear map from $V$ to $V^{\prime}$. (Recall from Section 3.F that $V^{\prime}=\mathcal{L}(V, \mathbf{F})$ and that $V^{\prime}$ is called the dual space of $V$.)
(b) Show that if $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{C}$ and $V \neq\{0\}$, then $\Phi$ is not a linear map.
(c) Show that $\Phi$ is injective.
(d) Suppose $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}$ and $V$ is finite-dimensional. Use parts (a) and (c) and a dimension-counting argument (but without using 6.42) to show that $\Phi$ is an isomorphism from $V$ onto $V^{\prime}$.
[Part (d) gives an alternative proof of the Riesz Representation Theorem (6.42) when $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}$. Part (d) also gives a natural isomorphism (meaning that it does not depend on a choice of basis) from a finite-dimensional real inner product space onto its dual space.]
