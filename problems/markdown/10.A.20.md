20 Suppose $V$ is a complex inner product space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Let $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}$ be the eigenvalues of $T$, repeated according to multiplicity. Suppose
\[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
A_{1,1} & \ldots & A_{1, n} \\
\vdots & & \vdots \\
A_{n, 1} & \ldots & A_{n, n}
\end{array}\right)
\]
is the matrix of $T$ with respect to some orthonormal basis of $V$. Prove that
\[
\left|\lambda_{1}\right|^{2}+\cdots+\left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2} \leq \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n}\left|A_{j, k}\right|^{2} .
\]
