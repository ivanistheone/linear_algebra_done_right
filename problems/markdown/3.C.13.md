13 Prove that the distributive property holds for matrix addition and matrix multiplication. In other words, suppose $A, B, C, D, E$, and $F$ are matrices whose sizes are such that $A(B+C)$ and $(D+E) F$ make sense. Prove that $A B+A C$ and $D F+E F$ both make sense and that $A(B+C)=A B+A C$ and $(D+E) F=D F+E F$
