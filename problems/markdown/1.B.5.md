5 Show that in the definition of a vector space (1.19), the additive inverse condition can be replaced with the condition that
\[
0 v=0 \text { for all } v \in V .
\]
Here the 0 on the left side is the number 0 , and the 0 on the right side is the additive identity of $V$. (The phrase "a condition can be replaced" in a definition means that the collection of objects satisfying the definition is unchanged if the original condition is replaced with the new condition.)
