8 Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. For $u, v \in V$, define $\langle u, v\rangle_{T}$ by
\[
\langle u, v\rangle_{T}=\langle T u, v\rangle .
\]
Prove that $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle_{T}$ is an inner product on $V$ if and only if $T$ is an invertible positive operator (with respect to the original inner product $(\cdot, \cdot\rangle)$.
