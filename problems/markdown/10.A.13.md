13 Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{C}^{3}\right)$ is the operator whose matrix is
\[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
51 & -12 & -21 \\
60 & -40 & -28 \\
57 & -68 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\]
Someone tells you (accurately) that $-48$ and 24 are eigenvalues of $T$. Without using a computer or writing anything down, find the third eigenvalue of $T$.
