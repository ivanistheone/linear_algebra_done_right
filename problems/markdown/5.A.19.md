19 Suppose $n$ is a positive integer and $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{F}^{n}\right)$ is defined by
\[
T\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=\left(x_{1}+\cdots+x_{n}, \ldots, x_{1}+\cdots+x_{n}\right)
\]
in other words, $T$ is the operator whose matrix (with respect to the standard basis) consists of all l's. Find all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $T$.
