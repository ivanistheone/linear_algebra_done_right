1 (a) Suppose $\theta \in \mathbf{R}$. Show that $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta),(-\sin \theta, \cos \theta)$ and $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta),(\sin \theta,-\cos \theta)$ are orthonormal bases of $\mathbf{R}^{2}$.
(b) Show that each orthonormal basis of $\mathbf{R}^{2}$ is of the form given by one of the two possibilities of part (a).
