13 Find $p \in \mathcal{P}_{5}(\mathbf{R})$ that makes
\[
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}|\sin x-p(x)|^{2} d x
\]
as small as possible.
[The polynomial $6.60$ is an excellent approximation to the answer to this exercise, but here you are asked to find the exact solution, which involves powers of $\pi$. A computer that can perform symbolic integration will be useful.]
