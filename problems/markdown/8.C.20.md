20 Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $V_{1}, \ldots, V_{m}$ are nonzero subspaces of $V$ such that $V=V_{1} \oplus \cdots \oplus V_{m}$. Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and each $V_{j}$ is invariant under $T$. For each $j$, let $p_{j}$ denote the characteristic polynomial of $\left.T\right|_{V_{j}}$. Prove that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ equals $p_{1} \cdots p_{m}$.
