24 Suppose $A$ is an $n$-by- $n$ matrix with entries in $\mathbf{F}$. Define $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{F}^{n}\right)$ by $T x=A x$, where elements of $\mathbf{F}^{n}$ are thought of as $n$-by-1 column vectors.
(a) Suppose the sum of the entries in each row of $A$ equals 1. Prove that 1 is an eigenvalue of $T$.
(b) Suppose the sum of the entries in each column of $A$ equals 1 . Prove that 1 is an eigenvalue of $T$.
