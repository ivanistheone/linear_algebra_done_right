19 Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Suppose that with respect to some basis of $V$ the matrix of $T$ is upper triangular, with $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}$ on the diagonal of this matrix. Prove that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ is $\left(z-\lambda_{1}\right) \cdots\left(z-\lambda_{n}\right)$.
