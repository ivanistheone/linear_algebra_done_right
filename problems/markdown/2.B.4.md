4 (a) Let $U$ be the subspace of $\mathbf{C}^{5}$ defined by
\[
U=\left\{\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}, z_{5}\right) \in \mathbf{C}^{5}: 6 z_{1}=z_{2} \text { and } z_{3}+2 z_{4}+3 z_{5}=0\right\} .
\]
Find a basis of $U$.
(b) Extend the basis in part (a) to a basis of $\mathbf{C}^{5}$.
(c) Find a subspace $W$ of $\mathbf{C}^{5}$ such that $\mathbf{C}^{5}=U \oplus W$.
