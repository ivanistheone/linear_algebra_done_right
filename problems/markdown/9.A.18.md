18 Suppose $V$ is a real vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Prove that the following are equivalent:
(a) All the eigenvalues of $T_{\mathbf{C}}$ are real.
(b) There exists a basis of $V$ with respect to which $T$ has an uppertriangular matrix.
(c) There exists a basis of $V$ consisting of generalized eigenvectors of $T$.
