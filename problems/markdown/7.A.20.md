20 Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$ and $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}$. Let $\Phi_{V}$ be the isomorphism from $V$ onto the dual space $V^{\prime}$ given by Exercise 17 in Section $6 . B$, and let $\Phi_{W}$ be the corresponding isomorphism from $W$ onto $W^{\prime}$. Show that if $\Phi_{V}$ and $\Phi_{W}$ are used to identify $V$ and $W$ with $V^{\prime}$ and $W^{\prime}$, then $T^{*}$ is identified with the dual map $T^{\prime}$. More precisely, show that $\Phi_{V} \circ T^{*}=T^{\prime} \circ \Phi_{W}$.
