10 Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is invertible. Let $p$ denote the characteristic polynomial of $T$ and let $q$ denote the characteristic polynomial of $T^{-1}$. Prove that
\[
q(z)=\frac{1}{p(0)} z^{\operatorname{dim} V} p\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)
\]
for all nonzero $z \in \mathbf{C}$.
