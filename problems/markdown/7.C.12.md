12 Give an example of two self-adjoint operators $T_{1}, T_{2} \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{F}^{4}\right)$ such that the eigenvalues of both operators are $2,5,7$ but there does not exist an isometry $S \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{F}^{4}\right)$ such that $T_{1}=S^{*} T_{2} S$. Be sure to explain why there is no isometry with the required property.
