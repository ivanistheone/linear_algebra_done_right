4 Suppose $V$ is a real inner product space.
(a) Show that $\langle u+v, u-v\rangle=\|u\|^{2}-\|v\|^{2}$ for every $u, v \in V$.
(b) Show that if $u, v \in V$ have the same norm, then $u+v$ is orthogonal to $u-v$.
(c) Use part (b) to show that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other.
