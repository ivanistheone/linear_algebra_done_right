15 Suppose $C_{\mathrm{R}}([-1,1])$ is the vector space of continuous real-valued functions on the interval $[-1,1]$ with inner product given by
\[
\langle f, g\rangle=\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) g(x) d x
\]
for $f, g \in C_{\mathbf{R}}([-1,1])$. Let $\varphi$ be the linear functional on $C_{\mathbf{R}}([-1,1])$ defined by $\varphi(f)=f(0)$. Show that there does not exist $g \in C_{\mathbf{R}}([-1,1])$ such that
\[
\varphi(f)=\langle f, g\rangle
\]
for every $f \in C_{\mathbf{R}}([-1,1])$.
[The exercise above shows that the Riesz Representation Theorem (6.42) does not hold on infinite-dimensional vector spaces without additional hypotheses on $V$ and $\varphi$.]
