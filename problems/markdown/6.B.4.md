4 Suppose $n$ is a positive integer. Prove that
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}, \frac{\cos x}{\sqrt{\pi}}, \frac{\cos 2 x}{\sqrt{\pi}}, \ldots, \frac{\cos n x}{\sqrt{\pi}}, \frac{\sin x}{\sqrt{\pi}}, \frac{\sin 2 x}{\sqrt{\pi}}, \ldots, \frac{\sin n x}{\sqrt{\pi}}
\]
is an orthonormal list of vectors in $C[-\pi, \pi]$, the vector space of continuous real-valued functions on $[-\pi, \pi]$ with inner product
\[
\langle f, g\rangle=\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) g(x) d x
\]
[The orthonormal list above is often used for modeling periodic phenomena such as tides.]
