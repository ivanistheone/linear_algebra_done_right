34 The double dual space of $V$, denoted $V^{\prime \prime}$, is defined to be the dual space of $V^{\prime}$. In other words, $V^{\prime \prime}=\left(V^{\prime}\right)^{\prime}$. Define $\Lambda: V \rightarrow V^{\prime \prime}$ by
\[
(\Lambda v)(\varphi)=\varphi(v)
\]
for $v \in V$ and $\varphi \in V^{\prime}$.
(a) Show that $\Lambda$ is a linear map from $V$ to $V^{\prime \prime}$.
(b) Show that if $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$, then $T^{\prime \prime} \circ \Lambda=\Lambda \circ T$, where $T^{\prime \prime}=\left(T^{\prime}\right)^{\prime}$.
(c) Show that if $V$ is finite-dimensional, then $\Lambda$ is an isomorphism from $V$ onto $V^{\prime \prime}$.
[Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then $V$ and $V^{\prime}$ are isomorphic, but finding an isomorphism from $V$ onto $V^{\prime}$ generally requires choosing a basis of $V$. In contrast, the isomorphism $\Lambda$ from $V$ onto $V^{\prime \prime}$ does not require a choice of basis and thus is considered more natural.]
