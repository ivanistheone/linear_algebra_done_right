2 Suppose $D \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathcal{P}_{3}(\mathbf{R}), \mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbf{R})\right)$ is the differentiation map defined by $D p=p^{\prime}$. Find a basis of $\mathcal{P}_{3}(\mathbf{R})$ and a basis of $\mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbf{R})$ such that the matrix of $D$ with respect to these bases is
\[
\left(\begin{array}{llll}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\right) .
\]
[Compare the exercise above to Example 3.34.
The next exercise generalizes the exercise above.]
