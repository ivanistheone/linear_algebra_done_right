4 Suppose $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ is a basis of $V$ and $W$ is finite-dimensional. Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Prove that there exists a basis $w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n}$ of $W$ such that all the entries in the first column of $\mathcal{M}(T)$ (with respect to the bases $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ and $w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n}$ ) are 0 except for possibly a 1 in the first row, first column.
[In this exercise, unlike Exercise 3, you are given the basis of $V$ instead of being able to choose a basis of $V$.]
