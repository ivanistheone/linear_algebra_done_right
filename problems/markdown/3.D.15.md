15 Prove that every linear map from $\mathbf{F}^{n, 1}$ to $\mathbf{F}^{m, 1}$ is given by a matrix multiplication. In other words, prove that if $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{F}^{n, 1}, \mathbf{F}^{m, 1}\right)$, then there exists an $m$-by-n matrix $A$ such that $T x=A x$ for every $x \in \mathbf{F}^{n, 1}$.
