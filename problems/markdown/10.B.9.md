9 Suppose $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ and $\sigma$ is a function from $\Omega$ to $\mathbf{R}^{n}$. Suppose $x \in \Omega$ and $\sigma$ is differentiable at $x$. Prove that the operator $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{R}^{n}\right)$ satisfying the equation in $10.56$ is unique.
[This exercise shows that the notation $\sigma^{\prime}(x)$ is justified.]
