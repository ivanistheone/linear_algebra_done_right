3 Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $n=\operatorname{dim} V>2$. Let $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}$ denote the eigenvalues of $T$ (or of $T_{\mathbf{C}}$ if $V$ is a real vector space), repeated according to multiplicity.
(a) Find a formula for the coefficient of $z^{n-2}$ in the characteristic polynomial of $T$ in terms of $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}$.
(b) Find a formula for the coefficient of $z$ in the characteristic polynomial of $T$ in terms of $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}$.
