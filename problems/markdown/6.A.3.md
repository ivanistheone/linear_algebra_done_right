3 Suppose $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}$ and $V \neq\{0\}$. Replace the positivity condition (which states that $\langle v, v\rangle \geq 0$ for all $v \in V)$ in the definition of an inner product (6.3) with the condition that $\langle v, v\rangle>0$ for some $v \in V$. Show that this change in the definition does not change the set of functions from $V \times V$ to $\mathbf{R}$ that are inner products on $V$.
