28 Suppose $C$ is a subset of $V$ with the property that $u, v \in C$ implies $\frac{1}{2}(u+v) \in C$. Let $w \in V$. Show that there is at most one point in $C$ that is closest to $w$. In other words, show that there is at most one $u \in C$ such that
\[
\|w-u\| \leq\|w-v\| \quad \text { for all } v \in C .
\]
Hint: Use the previous exercise.
