3 Suppose $U$ is a subspace of $V$ with basis $u_{1}, \ldots, u_{m}$ and
\[
u_{1}, \ldots, u_{m}, w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n}
\]
is a basis of $V$. Prove that if the Gram-Schmidt Procedure is applied to the basis of $V$ above, producing a list $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{m}, f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n}$, then $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{m}$ is an orthonormal basis of $U$ and $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n}$ is an orthonormal basis of $U^{\perp}$.
