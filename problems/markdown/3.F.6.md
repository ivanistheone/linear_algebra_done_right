6 Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m} \in V$. Define a linear $\operatorname{map} \Gamma: V^{\prime} \rightarrow \mathbf{F}^{m}$ by
\[
\Gamma(\varphi)=\left(\varphi\left(v_{1}\right), \ldots, \varphi\left(v_{m}\right)\right) .
\]
(a) Prove that $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ spans $V$ if and only if $\Gamma$ is injective.
(b) Prove that $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ is linearly independent if and only if $\Gamma$ is surjective.
