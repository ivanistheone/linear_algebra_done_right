4 Suppose $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m \leq n$, and suppose $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{m} \in \mathbf{F}$. Prove that there exists a polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ with $\operatorname{deg} p=n$ such that $0=p\left(\lambda_{1}\right)=\cdots=p\left(\lambda_{m}\right)$ and such that $p$ has no other zeros.
