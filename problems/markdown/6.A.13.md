13 Suppose $u, v$ are nonzero vectors in $\mathbf{R}^{2}$. Prove that
\[
\langle u, v\rangle=\|u\|\|v\| \cos \theta,
\]
where $\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$ (thinking of $u$ and $v$ as arrows with initial point at the origin).

Hint: Draw the triangle formed by $u, v$, and $u-v$; then use the law of cosines.
