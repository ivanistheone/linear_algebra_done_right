19 Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R}))$ is such that $T$ is injective and $\operatorname{deg} T p \leq \operatorname{deg} p$ for every nonzero polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R})$.
(a) Prove that $T$ is surjective.
(b) Prove that $\operatorname{deg} T p=\operatorname{deg} p$ for every nonzero $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R})$.
