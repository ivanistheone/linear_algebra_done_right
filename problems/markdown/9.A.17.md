17 Suppose $V$ is a real vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ satisfies $T^{2}=-I$. Define complex scalar multiplication on $V$ as follows: if $a, b \in \mathbf{R}$, then
\[
(a+b i) v=a v+b T v .
\]
(a) Show that the complex scalar multiplication on $V$ defined above and the addition on $V$ makes $V$ into a complex vector space.
(b) Show that the dimension of $V$ as a complex vector space is half the dimension of $V$ as a real vector space.
