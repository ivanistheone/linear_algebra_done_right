36 Suppose $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Let $i: U \rightarrow V$ be the inclusion map defined by $i(u)=u$. Thus $i^{\prime} \in \mathcal{L}\left(V^{\prime}, U^{\prime}\right)$.
(a) Show that null $i^{\prime}=U^{0}$.
(b) Prove that if $V$ is finite-dimensional, then range $i^{\prime}=U^{\prime}$.
(c) Prove that if $V$ is finite-dimensional, then $\widetilde{i^{\prime}}$ is an isomorphism from $V^{\prime} / U^{0}$ onto $U^{\prime}$.
[The isomorphism in part (c) is natural in that it does not depend on a choice of basis in either vector space.]
