8 Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V), S \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is an isometry, and $R \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is a positive operator such that $T=S R$. Prove that $R=\sqrt{T^{*} T}$.
[The exercise above shows that if we write $T$ as the product of an isometry and a positive operator (as in the Polar Decomposition 7.45), then the positive operator equals $\sqrt{T^{*} T}$.]
