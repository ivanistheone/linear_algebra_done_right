8 Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Prove that there does not exist a direct sum decomposition of $V$ into two proper subspaces invariant under $T$ if and only if the minimal polynomial of $T$ is of the form $(z-\lambda)^{\operatorname{dim} V}$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbf{C}$.
