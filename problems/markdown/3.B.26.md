26 Suppose $D \in \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R}), \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R}))$ is such that $\operatorname{deg} D p=(\operatorname{deg} p)-1$ for every nonconstant polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R})$. Prove that $D$ is surjective. [The notation $D$ is used above to remind you of the differentiation map that sends a polynomial p to p'. Without knowing the formula for the derivative of a polynomial (except that it reduces the degree by 1), you can use the exercise above to show that for every polynomial $q \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R})$, there exists a polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R})$ such that $\left.p^{\prime}=q .\right]$
