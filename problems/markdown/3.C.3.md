3 Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Prove that there exist a basis of $V$ and a basis of $W$ such that with respect to these bases, all entries of $\mathcal{M}(T)$ are 0 except that the entries in row $j$, column $j$, equal 1 for $1 \leq j \leq \operatorname{dim}$ range $T$.
