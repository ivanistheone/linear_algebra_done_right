11 Suppose $A$ is an $m$-by- $n$ matrix with $A \neq 0$. Prove that the rank of $A$ is 1 if and only if there exist $\left(c_{1}, \ldots, c_{m}\right) \in \mathbf{F}^{m}$ and $\left(d_{1}, \ldots, d_{n}\right) \in \mathbf{F}^{n}$ such that $A_{j, k}=c_{j} d_{k}$ for every $j=1, \ldots, m$ and every $k=1, \ldots, n$.
