20 Suppose $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Define $\Gamma: \mathcal{L}(V / U, W) \rightarrow \mathcal{L}(V, W)$ by
\[
\Gamma(S)=S \circ \pi .
\]
(a) Show that $\Gamma$ is a linear map.
(b) Show that $\Gamma$ is injective.
(c) Show that range $\Gamma=\{T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W): T u=0$ for every $u \in U\}$.
