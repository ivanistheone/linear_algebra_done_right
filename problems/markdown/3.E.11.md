11 Suppose $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m} \in V$. Let
\[
A=\left\{\lambda_{1} v_{1}+\cdots+\lambda_{m} v_{m}: \lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{m} \in \mathbf{F} \text { and } \lambda_{1}+\cdots+\lambda_{m}=1\right\} .
\]
(a) Prove that $A$ is an affine subset of $V$.
(b) Prove that every affine subset of $V$ that contains $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ also contains $A$.
(c) Prove that $A=v+U$ for some $v \in V$ and some subspace $U$ of $V$ with $\operatorname{dim} U \leq m-1$.
