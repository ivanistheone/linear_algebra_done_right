20 Suppose $n$ is a positive integer and $A_{i, j} \in \mathbf{F}$ for $i, j=1, \ldots, n$. Prove that the following are equivalent (note that in both parts below, the number of equations equals the number of variables):
(a) The trivial solution $x_{1}=\cdots=x_{n}=0$ is the only solution to the homogeneous system of equations
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{1, k} x_{k}=0
\]
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{n, k} x_{k}=0 .
\]
(b) For every $c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n} \in \mathbf{F}$, there exists a solution to the system of equations
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{1, k} x_{k}=c_{1} \\
\vdots \\
\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{n, k} x_{k}=c_{n} .
\end{array}
\]
