5 Suppose $w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n}$ is a basis of $W$ and $V$ is finite-dimensional. Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Prove that there exists a basis $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ of $V$ such that all the entries in the first row of $\mathcal{M}(T)$ (with respect to the bases $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ and $\left.w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n}\right)$ are 0 except for possibly a 1 in the first row, first column.
[In this exercise, unlike Exercise 3, you are given the basis of $W$ instead of being able to choose a basis of $W .]$
