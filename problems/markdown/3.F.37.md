37 Suppose $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Let $\pi: V \rightarrow V / U$ be the usual quotient map. Thus $\pi^{\prime} \in \mathcal{L}\left((V / U)^{\prime}, V^{\prime}\right)$.
(a) Show that $\pi^{\prime}$ is injective.
(b) Show that range $\pi^{\prime}=U^{0}$.
(c) Conclude that $\pi^{\prime}$ is an isomorphism from $(V / U)^{\prime}$ onto $U^{0}$.
[The isomorphism in part (c) is natural in that it does not depend on a choice of basis in either vector space. In fact, there is no assumption here that any of these vector spaces are finite-dimensional.]
