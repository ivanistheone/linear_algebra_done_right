21 Fix a positive integer $n$. In the inner product space of continuous realvalued functions on $[-\pi, \pi]$ with inner product
\[
\langle f, g\rangle=\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) g(x) d x,
\]
let
\[
V=\operatorname{span}(1, \cos x, \cos 2 x, \ldots, \cos n x, \sin x, \sin 2 x, \ldots, \sin n x) .
\]
(a) Define $D \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ by $D f=f^{\prime}$. Show that $D^{*}=-D$. Conclude that $D$ is normal but not self-adjoint.
(b) Define $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ by $T f=f^{\prime \prime}$. Show that $T$ is self-adjoint.
