30 Fix a positive integer $n$. The Laplacian $\Delta p$ of a twice differentiable function $p$ on $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ is the function on $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ defined by
\[
\Delta p=\frac{\partial^{2} p}{\partial x_{1}^{2}}+\cdots+\frac{\partial^{2} p}{\partial x_{n}^{2}} .
\]
The function $p$ is called harmonic if $\Delta p=0$.
A polynomial on $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ is a linear combination of functions of the form $x_{1}^{m_{1}} \cdots x_{n}^{m_{n}}$, where $m_{1}, \ldots, m_{n}$ are nonnegative integers.

Suppose $q$ is a polynomial on $\mathbf{R}^{n}$. Prove that there exists a harmonic polynomial $p$ on $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ such that $p(x)=q(x)$ for every $x \in \mathbf{R}^{n}$ with $\|x\|=1$.
[The only fact about harmonic functions that you need for this exercise is that if $p$ is a harmonic function on $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ and $p(x)=0$ for all $x \in \mathbf{R}^{n}$ with $\|x\|=1$, then $p=0 .]$

Hint: A reasonable guess is that the desired harmonic polynomial $p$ is of the form $q+\left(1-\|x\|^{2}\right) r$ for some polynomial $r$. Prove that there is a polynomial $r$ on $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ such that $q+\left(1-\|x\|^{2}\right) r$ is harmonic by defining an operator $T$ on a suitable vector space by
\[
T r=\Delta\left(\left(1-\|x\|^{2}\right) r\right)
\]
and then showing that $T$ is injective and hence surjective.
