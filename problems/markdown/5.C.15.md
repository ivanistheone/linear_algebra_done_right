15 Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{C}^{3}\right)$ is such that 6 and 7 are eigenvalues of $T$. Furthermore, suppose $T$ does not have a diagonal matrix with respect to any basis of $\mathbf{C}^{3}$. Prove that there exists $(x, y, z) \in \mathbf{F}^{3}$ such that $T(x, y, z)=(17+8 x, \sqrt{5}+8 y, 2 \pi+8 z)$.
