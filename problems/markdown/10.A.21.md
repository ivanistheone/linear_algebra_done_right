21 Suppose $V$ is an inner product space. Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and
\[
\left\|T^{*} v\right\| \leq\|T v\|
\]
for every $v \in V$. Prove that $T$ is normal.
[The exercise above fails on infinite-dimensional inner product spaces, leading to what are called hyponormal operators, which have a welldeveloped theory.]
