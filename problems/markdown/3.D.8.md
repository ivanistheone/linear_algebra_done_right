8 Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $T: V \rightarrow W$ is a surjective linear map of $V$ onto $W$. Prove that there is a subspace $U$ of $V$ such that $\left.T\right|_{U}$ is an isomorphism of $U$ onto $W$. (Here $\left.T\right|_{U}$ means the function $T$ restricted to $U$. In other words, $\left.T\right|_{U}$ is the function whose domain is $U$, with $\left.T\right|_{U}$ defined by $\left.T\right|_{U}(u)=T u$ for every $u \in U$.)
