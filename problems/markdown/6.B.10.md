10 Suppose $V$ is a real inner product space and $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}$ is a linearly independent list of vectors in $V$. Prove that there exist exactly $2^{m}$ orthonormal lists $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{m}$ of vectors in $V$ such that
\[
\operatorname{span}\left(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{j}\right)=\operatorname{span}\left(e_{1}, \ldots, e_{j}\right)
\]
for all $j \in\{1, \ldots, m\}$.
