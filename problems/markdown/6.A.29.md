29 For $u, v \in V$, define $d(u, v)=\|u-v\|$.
(a) Show that $d$ is a metric on $V$.
(b) Show that if $V$ is finite-dimensional, then $d$ is a complete metric on $V$ (meaning that every Cauchy sequence converges).
(c) Show that every finite-dimensional subspace of $V$ is a closed subset of $V$ (with respect to the metric $d$ ).
