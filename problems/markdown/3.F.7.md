7 Suppose $m$ is a positive integer. Show that the dual basis of the basis $1, x, \ldots, x^{m}$ of $\mathcal{P}_{m}(\mathbf{R})$ is $\varphi_{0}, \varphi_{1}, \ldots, \varphi_{m}$, where $\varphi_{j}(p)=\frac{p^{(j)}(0)}{j !}$. Here $p^{(j)}$ denotes the $j^{\text {th }}$ derivative of $p$, with the understanding that the $0^{\text {th }}$ derivative of $p$ is $p$.
